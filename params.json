{"name":"NDEx Cytoscape App","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the NDEx Cytoscape App!\r\nThe NDEx Cytoscape App provides a mechanism for you to take any network in Cytoscape and save it to NDEx. You can also download networks to Cytoscape from NDEx. The goal of the NDEx Cytoscape App is to be both easy to install and easy to use. (And if you have any ideas for how it could be even better, we want to hear from you.)\r\n\r\n### Why Use This App?\r\nNDEx provides a great location on the Internet where you can both save and share your networks! You can think of it as a sort of Google Drive for your networks, only with a lot more network-centric power. The NDEx Cytoscape App allows you to transfer your networks between Cytoscape, the leading desktop solution for visualizing biological networks, and NDEx. \r\n\r\n### What Sort of Networks Can I Store?\r\nAlthough we have biologists in mind, any kind of network can be stored in NDEx.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n* 64-bit Java 7\r\n* Cytoscape 3.1.1 or better\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you can install the NDEx Cytoscape App, you must have Cytoscape 3.1.1 or better installed along with Java 7.

To install Java 7, go here: http://www.java.com/en/download/manual_java7.jsp\r\n2. For instruction on how to set JAVA_HOME, go here: http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Java-Home\r\n3. To install Cytoscape 3.1.1 or later, go here: http://www.cytoscape.org/download.html\r\n\r\n### Install the NDEx Cytoscape App\r\nNow that you have Cytoscape installed and Java 7 setup correctly, it is time to installed the NDEx Cytoscape App. To do so, first you need to download it.
